		<h2>To Our Supporters</h2>
		<div class="supporters__content">
			<p class="drop-cap">Your 7-year-old walks to school, and you want to know when she gets to her second-grade classroom. Your newly minted teen driver is testing the real meaning of speed limits, and you want to be able to put the brakes on risky behavior. You rely on a convenient app like Life360 for its location tracking and driving safety features to protect what matters most to you. And Life360 turns around and sells your family’s private information to the highest bidder.</p>
			<p>But, thanks to you, The Markup’s young nonprofit newsroom—an incredible collection of journalists, programmers, technologists, engineers, analysts, and editors—is shedding light on how your data, and your life, are being monetized. We are chipping away atthe chokehold of Big Tech with meticulous analyses of massive datasets that allow us to reveal the hidden biases and flaws of the algorithms that govern our lives. We’ve managed to produce a stunning array of investigative journalism and create one-of-a-kind tools to give you control over your digital life. Pretty impressive for a lean team in our second year of publishing.</p>
			<p>At The Markup, we use our in-house expertise to help you understand the world around you. Our work isn’t designed to get clicks. It’s designed to have impact. Did we hold powerful institutions accountable for their decisions? Did our investigations help policymakers and individuals make better choices and give them the evidence they needed to create change?</p>
			<p>In 2021, the answer to all of the above was “Absolutely.” After our exposé on Life360, the app announced it would stop selling its users’ raw location data. And that wasn’t all that our journalism changed. The following report brings the impact of our work to life in greater focus.</p>
			<p>As a nonprofit, our work is funded only by those who are as committed to our mission as we are, and we are proud to be accountable to our supporters. We are committed to providing you with the transparency that we ourselves seek, because this calculus—tech expertise + engineering + investigative reporting—doesn’t add up without you.</p>
			<p>Thank you for being part of The Markup as we work to bring agency to readers navigating their lives in the digital age. We need your continued support to uncover the ways that technology is affecting our lives, our communities, and our work. We’re beyond grateful that you were part of The Markup’s story in 2021, and we can’t wait for you to see what we’ve got in the works in the coming year.</p>

		<h2>From the Board</h2>
		<div class="supporters__content">
			<p>Chairing the board of a startup organization is a bit like helping a baby bird venture out of the nest: thrilling, nerve-racking, and pride- inducing. And what a joy it has been to watch The Markup fly in its second year!</p>
			<p>As we look back on 2021, I’m energized by the impact The Markup’s work has had, which you’ll see detailed in this report, and by the growth this extraordinary organization has experienced. Our journalism, our tools, and our team have all evolved as our work has reached the halls of Congress, boardrooms across the world, and the lives of ordinary families. The Markup not only exposes how technology shapes our world but also outlines how we each can take action, providing a sense of agency in an increasingly uncertain world.</p>
			<p>The Markup’s Board of Directors, like its staff, is a collection of journalists, technologists, educators, and entrepreneurs, bound together by the belief that empowering people through technology will lead to a better society for us all. I’m immensely proud of each and every person who has shared their energy and expertise with The Markup and grateful to donors like you who have made it a philanthropic priority.</p>
			<p>Thank you for being part of The Markup’s young life. I hope you will continue to support us as we grow.</p>
